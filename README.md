# Unity ECS Roguelike
A "traditional" ascii roguelike built using Unity's ECS/DOTS framework. This project is based on the excellent [Rust Roguelike Tutorial](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/) by TheBracket.

### Project Structure
The project consists of the game itself in the "DotsRogue" folder, and several libraries in in the "Lib" folder. Of particular interest is the "Terminals" library which drives all the rendering in the game.
